# Solidity Examples
Some simple and clear examples of smart contract with solidity language

This is a collection of solidity examples that I practiced while I was learning about Solidity and writing smart contracts.

## How to Use

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Add one of the contracts to your workspace
3. Compile the contract to check for errors
4. Deploy the contract to the blockchain
